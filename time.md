### Palindrome

I started with creating the application. Implementing the logic for `isPalindrome` in the `Checker.php` file. Then I set up the tests for the `isPalindrome` in `CheckerTest.php`.  

I ran the tests to confirm the logic was working and then implemented the `PalindromeCommand.php` so I could test the logic with dynamic options.

### Console

Once I was happy with the implementation of the `commands` and `tests` I decided to move onto the other tasks.

***

### Anagram & Pangram

Now I was looking to implement the logic for `isAnagram` & `isPangram` in `Checker.php`. I was doing these two at the same time and then I implemented the testing for these two new features. When the tests were returning the results I wanted; I then added the commands to the console.

### Formatting

After I had implemented the working logic with all of the application working as expected. I then opted to format the code and make it more readable and understandable. This was by updating: variable names, using consitent naming across files and creating reuseable functions.

### Timing

The overall application took ~2hours 30 minutes. I spent two hours on creating the application and testing the app itself. The two hours includes: creating the functionality; setting up the commands and tests.  
The final 30 minutes I spent documenting and formatting the code. The documenting includes creating the two `md` files that were requested as a part of the task.
